\arguments{
\item{data}{data, a data frame in survival format}

\item{formula}{a formula object that specifies the formula for the poisson regression.
This also decides the formula will be used the function to check positivity overlap.}

\item{treatment}{a character variable that specifies the name of the treatment}

\item{covariates}{a character variable storing the name of the covariate(s)}

\item{time}{a character variables that specifies the name of the time variable}

\item{outcome}{a character variables that specifies the name of the outcome variable}

\item{model}{a character variable recording which mode of model was used}

\item{priorSD}{a numeric variable as the user-defined standard deviation for beta coefficients prior}

\item{chains}{the number of chains for sampling, the default is 1}

\item{partition}{a numeric vector for the partition}

\item{midpoint}{a numeric vector for the midpoints of intervals}

\item{haz_draws}{a \code{mcmc.list} for the baseline hazard rates from posterior draws}

\item{beta_draws}{a \code{mcmc.list} for the beta coefficients estimated from posterior draws}
}
\value{
It returns an object of class \code{bayeshaz}
}
\description{
