  A,

\arguments{
\item{data}{data, a data frame in survival format. Categorical variables should be
transformed into dummy variables}

\item{reg_formula}{a formula object that specifies the formula for the poisson regression.
This also decides the formula will be used the function to check positivity overlap.}

\item{A}{a character variable that specifies the name of the treatment}

\item{model}{a character variable that tells the stan model used to implement the Bayesian piece-wise exponential model,
default is "AR1" and the other option is "independent"}

\item{priorSD}{a numeric variable as the user-defined standard deviation for beta coefficients prior, the default is 3}

\item{num_partition}{a numeric variable as the number of intervals in the partition, the default is 100}

\item{warmup}{a numeric variable as the number of warmup in MCMC, the default is 1000}

\item{post_iter}{a numeric variable as the number of iterations to draw from the posterior, the default is 1000}

\item{chains}{the number of chains for sampling, the default is 1}
}
\value{
It returns an object of class \code{bayeshaz} that contains the information about the data, model, etc.
This serves as the basis for the extended functions in this package.

An object of class \code{bayeshaz} is a list containing at least the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{data}, a data frame for the data
\item \code{formula}, the regression formula
\item \code{treatment}, the name of the treatment variable
\item \code{covariates}, the name of the covariate(s)
\item \code{time}, the name of the time variable
\item \code{outcome}, the name of the outcome variable
\item \code{model}, the type of the model used
\item \code{priorSD}, the prior standard deviation specified
\item \code{chains}, the number of chains for sampling
\item \code{partition}, the partition vector
\item \code{midpoint}, the midpoints of intervals
\item \code{haz_draws}, a \code{mcmc.list} object storing the baseline hazard rate from each posterior draws
\item \code{beta_draws}, a \code{mcmc.list} object storing the beta coefficients estimated from each posterior draws
}

The \code{mcmc.list} is an object type from package \code{coda} and helps users check convergence.

\description{
Perform a Bayesian piece-wise exponential model on the given survival data,
and this function implements it by an equivalent poisson regression in MCMC.
}
\details{
A typical model has the form \code{Surv(time, outcome) ~ covariates}. The function will capture
the outcome and covariates based on this formula object.

The Bayesian piece-wise exponential model uses normal prior for baseline hazard rate,
beta coefficients, and the error term for baseline hazard rate to form the first-order Gaussian process.
It uses a beta prior to generate the correlation from -1 to 1 for hazard rate.
For more details, users can check the full model listed in the reference.

Under the \code{AR1} model, user can specify the standard deviation for the normal prior of the beta coefficients.
The default is 3, and only values between 0 and 3 are accepted since 3 is already a relatively weak prior.
